4020. Elevator Requests I

You are given an integer n denoting the number of floors in a building, where the floors are numbered from 0 to n - 1.

You are also given an integer array requests, where requests represents the sequence of floor requests.

An elevator starts at floor 0 and follows these rules:

    The elevator moves one floor per second.
    The elevator serves requests in the given order.
    If the elevator is already on the requested floor, no movement is needed.
    After serving a request, the elevator immediately starts moving toward the next request.

Return the total time in seconds required to serve all requests.

Example 1:

Input: n = 5, requests = [2,1,4,3]

Output: 7

Explanation:

    requests[0] = 2: Moving from floor 0 to floor 2 takes 2 seconds.
    requests[1] = 1: Moving from floor 2 to floor 1 takes 1 second.
    requests[2] = 4: Moving from floor 1 to floor 4 takes 3 seconds.
    requests[3] = 3: Moving from floor 4 to floor 3 takes 1 second.

The total time required is 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 7 seconds.

Example 2:

Input: n = 3, requests = [2,0,0]

Output: 4

Explanation:

    requests[0] = 2: Moving from floor 0 to floor 2 takes 2 seconds.
    requests[1] = 0: Moving from floor 2 to floor 0 takes 2 seconds.
    requests[2] = 0: No movement is needed.

The total time required is 2 + 2 + 0 = 4 seconds.

Constraints:

    1 <= n <= 100
    1 <= requests.length <= 100
    0 <= requests[i] <= n - 1
