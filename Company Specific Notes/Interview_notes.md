## Tips for the Interview

- After the interviewer gave the question, don’t rush to the solution directly. 
The interviewer is expecting you to **ask questions, to clarify the problem.** 
In this part, they are testing if you have the ability to clarify the problem, and also your communication intention and skill.(the aim of your function, input/output data type, edge cases needed to consider, etc.)

- In high level, explain your algorithm first, **never jump to code without the interviewer’s agreement.**
In complex questions, think from the brute force solution, and think how to optimize it. 
Don’t wait for the best solution if you don’t have yet. Remember to get the **interviewer’s agreement** before writing code.

- During your implementation, if the interviewer asks you some questions, stop and think about it. 
The interviewer is giving you a **hint by asking you questions. **

- **Never “argue”** about different workaround. The **best practice is to write out what’s in the interviewer’s mind.** 
Be nice and treat the interviewer as your colleague.

- Asking hints directly is not good. You can come up with different solutions and ask for hints implicitly.

- **Don't give up**
