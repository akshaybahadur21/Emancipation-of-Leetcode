3745. Maximize Expression of Three Elements

You are given an integer array nums.

Choose three elements a, b, and c from nums at distinct indices such that the value of the expression a + b - c is maximized.

Return an integer denoting the maximum possible value of this expression.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,4,2,5]

Output: 8

Explanation:

We can choose a = 4, b = 5, and c = 1. The expression value is 4 + 5 - 1 = 8, which is the maximum possible.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [-2,0,5,-2,4]

Output: 11

Explanation:

We can choose a = 5, b = 4, and c = -2. The expression value is 5 + 4 - (-2) = 11, which is the maximum possible.

Constraints:

    3 <= nums.length <= 100
    -100 <= nums[i] <= 100
