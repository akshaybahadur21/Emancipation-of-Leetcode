3884. First Matching Character From Both Ends

You are given a string s of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.

Return the smallest index i such that s[i] == s[n - i - 1].

If no such index exists, return -1.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcacbd"

Output: 1

Explanation:

At index i = 1, s[1] and s[5] are both 'b'.

No smaller index satisfies the condition, so the answer is 1.

Example 2:

Input: s = "abc"

Output: 1

Explanation:

​​​​​​​At index i = 1, the two compared positions coincide, so both characters are 'b'.

No smaller index satisfies the condition, so the answer is 1.

Example 3:

Input: s = "abcdab"

Output: -1

Explanation:

​​​​​​​For every index i, the characters at positions i and n - i - 1 are different.

Therefore, no valid index exists, so the answer is -1.

Constraints:

    1 <= n == s.length <= 100
    s consists of lowercase English letters.
