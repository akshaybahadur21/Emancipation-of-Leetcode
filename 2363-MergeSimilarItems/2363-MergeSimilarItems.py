2363. Merge Similar Items

You are given two 2D integer arrays, items1 and items2, representing two sets of items. Each array items has the following properties:

    items[i] = [valuei, weighti] where valuei represents the value and weighti represents the weight of the ith item.
    The value of each item in items is unique.

Return a 2D integer array ret where ret[i] = [valuei, weighti], with weighti being the sum of weights of all items with value valuei.

Note: ret should be returned in ascending order by value.

Example 1:

Input: items1 = [[1,1],[4,5],[3,8]], items2 = [[3,1],[1,5]]
Output: [[1,6],[3,9],[4,5]]
Explanation: 
The item with value = 1 occurs in items1 with weight = 1 and in items2 with weight = 5, total weight = 1 + 5 = 6.
The item with value = 3 occurs in items1 with weight = 8 and in items2 with weight = 1, total weight = 8 + 1 = 9.
The item with value = 4 occurs in items1 with weight = 5, total weight = 5.  
Therefore, we return [[1,6],[3,9],[4,5]].

Example 2:

Input: items1 = [[1,1],[3,2],[2,3]], items2 = [[2,1],[3,2],[1,3]]
Output: [[1,4],[2,4],[3,4]]
Explanation: 
The item with value = 1 occurs in items1 with weight = 1 and in items2 with weight = 3, total weight = 1 + 3 = 4.
The item with value = 2 occurs in items1 with weight = 3 and in items2 with weight = 1, total weight = 3 + 1 = 4.
The item with value = 3 occurs in items1 with weight = 2 and in items2 with weight = 2, total weight = 2 + 2 = 4.
Therefore, we return [[1,4],[2,4],[3,4]].

Example 3:

Input: items1 = [[1,3],[2,2]], items2 = [[7,1],[2,2],[1,4]]
Output: [[1,7],[2,4],[7,1]]
Explanation:
The item with value = 1 occurs in items1 with weight = 3 and in items2 with weight = 4, total weight = 3 + 4 = 7. 
The item with value = 2 occurs in items1 with weight = 2 and in items2 with weight = 2, total weight = 2 + 2 = 4. 
The item with value = 7 occurs in items2 with weight = 1, total weight = 1.
Therefore, we return [[1,7],[2,4],[7,1]].

Constraints:

    1 <= items1.length, items2.length <= 1000
    items1[i].length == items2[i].length == 2
    1 <= valuei, weighti <= 1000
    Each valuei in items1 is unique.
    Each valuei in items2 is unique.
