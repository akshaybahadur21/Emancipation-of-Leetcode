3442. Maximum Difference Between Even and Odd Frequency I

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Your task is to find the maximum difference diff = a1 - a2 between the frequency of characters a1 and a2 in the string such that:

    a1 has an odd frequency in the string.
    a2 has an even frequency in the string.

Return this maximum difference.

Example 1:

Input: s = "aaaaabbc"

Output: 3

Explanation:

    The character 'a' has an odd frequency of 5, and 'b' has an even frequency of 2.
    The maximum difference is 5 - 2 = 3.

Example 2:

Input: s = "abcabcab"

Output: 1

Explanation:

    The character 'a' has an odd frequency of 3, and 'c' has an even frequency of 2.
    The maximum difference is 3 - 2 = 1.

Constraints:

    3 <= s.length <= 100
    s consists only of lowercase English letters.
    s contains at least one character with an odd frequency and one with an even frequency.
