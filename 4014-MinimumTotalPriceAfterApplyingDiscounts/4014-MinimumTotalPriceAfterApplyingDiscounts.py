4014. Minimum Total Price After Applying Discounts

You are given two integer arrays prices and discounts.

The value prices[i] represents the price of the ith item, and discounts[j] represents a discount percentage.

You may apply discounts subject to the following rules:

    Each discount can be applied to at most one item.
    Each item can receive at most one discount.
    An item may also receive no discount.

If a discount of d percent is applied to an item with price p, its final price becomes (p * (100 - d)) / 100. The final price is not rounded.

Return the minimum possible sum of final prices after assigning discounts optimally. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

Example 1:

Input: prices = [10,30,21], discounts = [50,60]

Output: 32.50000

Explanation:

    Apply discounts[1] = 60 to prices[1] = 30, thus 30 * (100 - 60) / 100 = 12.
    Apply discounts[0] = 50 to prices[2] = 21, thus 21 * (100 - 50) / 100 = 10.5.
    prices[0] = 10 receives no discount, so it stays 10.

The total is 12 + 10.5 + 10 = 32.50000, which is the minimum possible.

Example 2:

Input: prices = [100,70], discounts = [10,40,50]

Output: 92.00000

Explanation:​​​​​​​

    Apply discounts[2] = 50 to prices[0] = 100, thus 100 * (100 - 50) / 100 = 50.
    Apply discounts[1] = 40 to prices[1] = 70, thus 70 * (100 - 40) / 100 = 42.

The total is 50 + 42 = 92.00000, which is the minimum possible.

Example 3:

Input: prices = [7,3,9], discounts = [100,100]

Output: 3.00000

Explanation:

    Apply discounts[0] = 100 to prices[2] = 9, thus 9 * (100 - 100) / 100 = 0.
    Apply discounts[1] = 100 to prices[0] = 7, thus 7 * (100 - 100) / 100 = 0.
    prices[1] = 3 receives no discount, so it stays 3.

The total is 0 + 0 + 3 = 3.00000, which is the minimum possible.

Constraints:

    1 <= prices.length, discounts.length <= 105
    1 <= prices[i] <= 105
    1 <= discounts[j] <= 100
