3774. Absolute Difference Between Maximum and Minimum K Elements

You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.

Find the absolute difference between:

    the sum of the k largest elements in the array; and
    the sum of the k smallest elements in the array.

Return an integer denoting this difference.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,2,2,4], k = 2

Output: 5

Explanation:

    The k = 2 largest elements are 4 and 5. Their sum is 4 + 5 = 9.
    The k = 2 smallest elements are 2 and 2. Their sum is 2 + 2 = 4.
    The absolute difference is abs(9 - 4) = 5.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [100], k = 1

Output: 0

Explanation:

    The largest element is 100.
    The smallest element is 100.
    The absolute difference is abs(100 - 100) = 0.

Constraints:

    1 <= n == nums.length <= 100
    1 <= nums[i] <= 100
    1 <= k <= n
