2956. Find Common Elements Between Two Arrays

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2 of sizes n and m, respectively. Calculate the following values:

    answer1 : the number of indices i such that nums1[i] exists in nums2.
    answer2 : the number of indices i such that nums2[i] exists in nums1.

Return [answer1,answer2].

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [2,3,2], nums2 = [1,2]

Output: [2,1]

Explanation:

Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [4,3,2,3,1], nums2 = [2,2,5,2,3,6]

Output: [3,4]

Explanation:

The elements at indices 1, 2, and 3 in nums1 exist in nums2 as well. So answer1 is 3.

The elements at indices 0, 1, 3, and 4 in nums2 exist in nums1. So answer2 is 4.

Example 3:

Input: nums1 = [3,4,2,3], nums2 = [1,5]

Output: [0,0]

Explanation:

No numbers are common between nums1 and nums2, so answer is [0,0].

Constraints:

    n == nums1.length
    m == nums2.length
    1 <= n, m <= 100
    1 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 100
