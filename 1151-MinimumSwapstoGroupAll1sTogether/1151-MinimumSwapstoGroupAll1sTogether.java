1151. Minimum Swaps to Group All 1's Together
Medium

Given a binary array data, return the minimum number of swaps required to group all 1â€™s present in the array together in any place in the array.

Example 1:

Input: data = [1,0,1,0,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
There are 3 ways to group all 1's together:
[1,1,1,0,0] using 1 swap.
[0,1,1,1,0] using 2 swaps.
[0,0,1,1,1] using 1 swap.
The minimum is 1.

Example 2:

Input: data = [0,0,0,1,0]
Output: 0
Explanation: 
Since there is only one 1 in the array, no swaps needed.

Example 3:

Input: data = [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
One possible solution that uses 3 swaps is [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1].

Example 4:

Input: data = [1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1]
Output: 8

Constraints:

    1 <= data.length <= 105
    data[i] is 0 or 1.

        for(int d : data) {
            if(d == 1) total++;
        }
        int max = 0, curr = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < total; i++){
            if(data[i] == 1) curr++;
        }
        max = Math.max(max, curr);
        for(int i = total; i < data.length; i++){
            int l = data[i - total];
            int r = data[i];
            if(l == 1) curr--;
            if(r == 1) curr++;
            max = Math.max(curr, max);
        }
        return total - max;
    }
